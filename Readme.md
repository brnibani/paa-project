## Average number of checks for Quicksort

Authors: Tommaso Papini (5537529), Gabriele Bani (5719258)

### Goals
- Implement Quicksort algorithm with checks counting for simulation purposes [DONE]
- Explain how to obtain the main base recurrence [DONE]
- Solve the recurrence with the difference method [DONE, more comments needed]
- Solve the recurrence with the generating function method [DONE, more comments needed]
- Test & compare

### ToFix:
- keep the original sign when extracting a power out of a log (generating functions)
