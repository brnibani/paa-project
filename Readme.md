# PAA Project, a.y. 2015/2016
## Average number of checks for Quicksort

Authors: Tommaso Papini (5537529), Gabriele Bani (5719258)

### Goals
- Implement Quicksort algorithm with checks counting for simulation purposes [DONE]
- Explain how to obtain the main base recurrence [DONE]
- Solve the recurrence with the difference method [DONE, few things to be checked]
- Solve the recurrence with the generating function method [ongoing...]

### ToCheck/ToFix:
- Abstract from iteration to summation (difference method)
- Rewrite summation as Harmonic series (difference method)
- Match only factors that contains n (generating functions)
